## Keyboard shortcuts in Windows

**[keyboard shortcuts](https://github.com/tech0issues/keyboard.shortcuts)** are keys or a combination of keys you can press on your keyboard to perform a variety of tasks. Using keyboard shortcuts is often faster than using a mouse because you can keep both hands on the keyboard. **[keyboard shortcuts](https://github.com/tech0issues/keyboard.shortcuts)** are also universal, which means you can use many of the same shortcuts in a variety of applications. For example, you can use the shortcuts to copy and paste text in a word processor and in a web browser.
